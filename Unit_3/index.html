<h1>Heart of Mercy</h1>
<h2>A Catholic Worker Community in Baton Rouge</h2>
<p id="slogan">Jesus Christ is the face of the Father's mercy</p>
<p>The central vision of the Catholic Worker Movement is to work for:</p>
<em><ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>a new heaven</li>
<li>and a new earth,</li>
<li>wherein justice dwelleth.<li></ul></em>
<p>This vision recognizes the primacy of the spiritual and the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ. The Catholic Worker is a new way of life involving Houses of Hospitality for the daily practice of the Works of Mercy... - Dorothy Day, The Catholic Worker, 1940.</p>
