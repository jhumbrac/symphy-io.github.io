<h1>Heart of Mercy</h1>
<h2>A Catholic Worker Community in Baton Rouge</h2>
<p>The central vision of the Catholic Worker Movement is to work for: a new heaven and a new earth, wherein justice dwelleth. This vision recognizes the primacy of the spiritual and the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ. The Catholic Worker is a new way of life involving Houses of Hospitality for the daily practice of the Works of Mercy... - Dorothy Day, The Catholic Worker, 1940.</p>
