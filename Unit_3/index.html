	<h1>Heart of Mercy</h1>
	<h3>A Catholic Worker Community in Baton Rouge</h3>
	<p>The central vision of the Catholic Worker Movement is to work for:</p>
	<em><ul style="list-style-type:none">
		<li>a new heaven</li>
		<li>and a new earth,</li>
		<li>wherein justice dwelleth.<li></ul></em>
	<p>This vision recognizes the primacy of the spiritual and the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ.<br>The Catholic Worker is a new way of life involving Houses of Hospitality for the daily practice of the Works of Mercy...<br><i>- Dorothy Day, The Catholic Worker, 1940.</i></p>
